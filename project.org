** About

REPL tools to migrate GitHub repos into SourceHut

** Overview
This is only half working.  Right now it clones GitHub repos locally.
It doesn't create repos in SourceHut yet.
Create a .config file in the gh-to-sourcehut package directory

#+begin_src javascript
  {
      gh_username: "somebody",
      gh_token: "ghp_your_token",
      sh_username: "somebody",
      sh_token: "your_sh_token",
  }
  #+end_src

  #+begin_src lisp
    (ql:quickload :gh-to-sourcehut)
    ;; Edit .config in the gh-to-sourcehut package directory and reload
    (ql:quickload :gh-to-sourcehut)
    (multiple-value-setq (*failed* *succeeded*)
    (gh-to-sourcehut:clone-user-gh-repos "jl2" "/temp/jl2-repos/")
  #+end_src
