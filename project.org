* github-to-sourcehut

** About

This is a Common Lisp REPL utility package to mirror GitHub repos on SourceHut.

Eventually it may support mirroring to BitBucket and more advanced mirroring
scenarios, but for right now it's very basic.

** Usage
Create a .config file in the github-to-sourcehut package directory.  It should
have the following fields:

#+begin_src javascript
  {
      gh_username: "somebody",
      gh_token: "ghp_your_token",
      sh_username: "somebody",
      sh_token: "your_sh_token",
  }
#+end_src

Load :github-to-sourcehut in the Lisp REPL and run
#'mirror-github-repos-on-sourcehut:

#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :github-to-sourcehut)
  (time
   (github-to-sourcehut:mirror-github-repos-on-sourcehut
    "/home/jeremiah/my-temp-repos/"
    :thread-count 24))
#+end_src
