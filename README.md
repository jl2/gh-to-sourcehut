### _Jeremiah LaRocco <jeremiah_larocco@fastmail.com>_

This is (will be) a tool to clone repos from GitHub and create corresponding repos on Sourcehut.

Eventually it may support going the other direction, and more advanced mirroring scenarios.

See project.org for more information and instructions for how to use it.
